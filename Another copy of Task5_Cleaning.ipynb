The dataset was loaded using pandas `read_csv()` to begin the data analysis process.\n","2. Initial exploration was done using `head()` and `info()` to understand the dataset structure and datatypes.\n","3. Missing values were checked using `isnull().sum()` to identify columns requiring cleaning.\n","4. Although no missing values were found, standard imputation techniques were applied:\n","   - Mean imputation for numerical columns\n","   - Mode imputation for categorical columns\n","5. Duplicate records were checked and removed using `drop_duplicates()` to ensure data quality.\n","6. Datatype conversion was performed using `astype()` to optimize memory usage and improve analysis accuracy.\n","7. A new feature `average_score` was created by combining math, reading, and writing scores.\n","8. Another derived column `performance_category` was created to classify students based on their average score.\n","9. The cleaned and transformed dataset was saved as a CSV file for further analysis and reporting."],"metadata":{"id":"ANYhHGIoOwc4"}}]}
